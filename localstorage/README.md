## Localstorage in Elm

There is currently no native way to use Localstorage in Elm.

Here is an example from the [TodoMVC app](https://github.com/evancz/elm-todomvc/blob/master/index.html) that uses Javascript and ports.

Alternatively, fredcy is working on a [localstorage library](https://github.com/fredcy/localstorage) that is currently in development.
