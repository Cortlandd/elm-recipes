## Elm Recipes

This set of tutorials is intended to demonstrate example code and explanations for common tasks in Elm.

If you haven't already, I highly recommend going through the official [Elm Guide](http://guide.elm-lang.org/) which explains the most important fundamental concepts.

The goal of Elm Recipes is to provide example projects that demonstrate how to accomplish a wide variety of tasks using Elm. If you have any requests for tutorials, please contact me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/alexspurling).

*(All of these tutorials were written for Elm 0.17.0. If you are using a more recent version of the language, please note some details may now be out of date.)*
