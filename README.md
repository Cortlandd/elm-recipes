## Elm Recipes

This set of tutorials is intended to demonstrate example code and explanations for common tasks in Elm.

If you haven't already, I highly recommend going through the official [Elm Guide](http://guide.elm-lang.org/) which explains the most important fundamental concepts.

All of these tutorials were written for **Elm 0.17.0**. If you are using a more recent version of the language, please note some details may now be out of date.
